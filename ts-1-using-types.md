# Using Types

- JavaScript - string, number, and boolean, date type ==>object
- type of a null => object
- TypeScript will infer the type from the value assignment.
- Optional function parameters ?
- TypeScript doesnâ€™t exist at runtime - it is a development tool. So, TypeScript won't do any type checking on the code at runtime.
- A primitive type -> infers a literal type.
- A non-primitive type -> same type as assigned.

```js
function add(a: number, b?: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
add(3)

//TypeScript can automatically infer the type of a variable from the value it is assigned.
let score = 10;
console.log(score); //number
let dateOfBirth = new Date(1990, 4, 7); //Date
//TypeScript can infer types that don't exist in JavaScript.
const firstName = "Bob"; //the type is 'Bob'!
const age = 31; //The type is 31.
const created = new Date(2019, 11, 6);//The type is Date
let counter; //any type
counter = 10;
```

## Quiz

**Question 3**

```

- A: NO. TypeScript can infer the type from the value assignment in the declaration.

**Question 4**

- Is the type annotation necessary to type the message parameter to string in the declaration below?

```ts
function logMessage(message: string) {}
```

- A: TypeScript can't infer the type of the message parameter and so a type annotation is needed.
